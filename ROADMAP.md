# Roadmap

This is a high-level roadmap; items may shift based on community needs.

## Next
- Real SSR rendering pipeline (streaming, React/Vue adapters)
- Schema-driven codegen for migrations/types/contracts
- Database adapters (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)
- CLI `aurora init` improvements (fetch templates, upgrades)
- Stable plugin API and lifecycle hooks

## Later
- Incremental compilation and dev server
- Observability integrations (OpenTelemetry)
- Built-in auth/billing templates

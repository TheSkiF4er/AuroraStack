# AuroraStack Code of Conduct

AuroraStack is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from people all over the world.  
We want this community to be **friendly, safe, and inclusive** for everyone, regardless of background or experience level.

This Code of Conduct explains what we expect from all participants and how we respond when behavior falls short of these expectations.

- gender identity or expression,
- level of experience,
- education,
- socio-economic status,
- nationality,
- personal appearance,
- race,
- religion (or lack thereof),
- sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that help build a **respectful, welcoming, and collaborative** community.

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.
- Taking appropriate and fair action in response to any unacceptable behavior.
- Removing, editing, or rejecting:
  - comments,
  - commits,
  - code,
  - wiki edits,
  - issues,
  - pull requests  
  that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may be removed from their roles.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- The main **AuroraStack repository** (`https://github.com/TheSkiF4er/AuroraStack`),
- Official packages, templates, and example projects under the AuroraStack organization/namespace,
- Public community spaces, including:
  - GitHub Issues,
  - Pull Requests,
  - Discussions,
  - comments and code reviews,
- Any other project-related spaces where community members interact on behalf of the project, whether online or offline.

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project, such as:

- using the project’s official channels,
- speaking at meetups or conferences as an AuroraStack representative,
- participating in recorded talks, streams, or tutorials about AuroraStack in an official capacity.

## Reporting a Code of Conduct Issue

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **If it’s safe to do so**, ask the person to stop the behavior.
2. Report the issue to the project maintainers as soon as possible.

### How to report

You can report issues in one of the following ways:

- Via GitHub:
  - Open a **new issue** in the AuroraStack repository and mark it clearly as a **“Code of Conduct”** concern.  
    Do **not** include sensitive personal details in the public description; you can request a private follow-up.
- If private contact options (e.g. email or a dedicated contact form) are added in the future, they will be listed here and in the repository’s README.

When reporting, please include:

- What happened, in as much detail as you are comfortable sharing.
- Where and when it happened (links, timestamps, context).
- Any additional context that might be helpful (e.g. if it happened repeatedly, if others were involved, etc.).
- Whether you want your report to remain anonymous (to the extent possible).

We will treat all reports with **seriousness, discretion, and respect for your privacy**.

---

## Enforcement

After receiving a report, maintainers will:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt of the report as soon as reasonably possible.
2. **Review** the incident, gathering additional information if needed.
3. **Decide on an appropriate response**, which may include (but is not limited to):
   - a private warning,
   - a request for an apology or change in behavior,
   - temporary or permanent ban from:
     - GitHub Issues,
     - Pull Requests,
     - Discussions,
   - removal of commit access or maintainer roles,
   - other actions deemed appropriate to protect the community.

We aim to handle enforcement **fairly, consistently, and transparently**, while respecting the privacy of those involved.

If you believe a maintainer has a conflict of interest in a situation, you may say so in your report; where possible, that maintainer will be excluded from the review of your case.

---

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was taken in error or was unfair:

- You may request a review by:
  - opening a **private communication** with the maintainers (using the same reporting channels), or
  - following any escalation path that may be documented in the future.

Keep in mind that not all details of enforcement decisions can be shared publicly, especially where privacy is a concern.

---

## Relation to Security Issues

This Code of Conduct focuses on **behavioral and community** matters.

For **security vulnerabilities** (bugs that expose users or systems to risk):

- Please refer to the **[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)** document.
- Do **not** use public issues to report security vulnerabilities.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by and adapted from:

- The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) (version 2.1),
- Other open-source project codes of conduct from the broader community.

We are grateful to the open-source ecosystem for providing templates and prior art that help projects foster safe and inclusive communities.
